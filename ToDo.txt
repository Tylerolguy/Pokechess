do i need paint in battlescne or can i jsut call paint components




pokemon - stats

move data - move data






the selector is both a model and has important data of what pokmeon is selected, maybe move that out?





Abstract the selector paint, for range, what pokemon get red target and which get green target yellow for something.


change selector valid targets for the move selector (update for if using a self move or ally move)
also add in, if no mana or auto attacks left, change the color
